The related lists you can view and use depend on:
	1. Your user permissions
	2. User interface and page layout customizations made by your Salesforce administrator
	3. Personal customizations you can make


Limitations of Related List
---------------------------
Salesforce provides the "Related List" and "Related Lists" standard Lightning Components in order to show related records. But this standard component has a few limitations such as a 
1. lack of custom sorting, 
2. an inability to search using specific fields, 
3. no custom filters, 
4. no pagination/infinite scrolling to load more data, and 
5. difficulty in terms of formatting columns with appropriate data types (such as email, phone, currency, etc.)
6. No auto refresh the data
	A manual page refresh is sometimes required in order for your related lists to show the latest changes. A manual page refresh is needed if:
	1. You create, update, or delete a related record with an Apex controller.
	2. You create, update, or delete a related record with a flow.
	3. Another user creates, updates, or deletes a related record.
	4. Emails are sent but not showing up in the related list.

 
Enhanced Realated List
----------------------
1. Sorting the data (default order is by record id)
   https://salesforcethinkers.home.blog/2019/08/20/add-more-fields-to-related-lists-salesforce/

2. Filters the data through Related List Filters
    Note: these filters are not saved in the database. each time user needs to filter the data.

3. Mass Actions to perform bulk operations through quick actions (or buttons)

4. Break up Salesforce Related Lists into Tabs (map recordList single into each tab)

5. we can change (add/remove) the fields to display in related list through page layouts (related lists) 
    https://silverlinecrm.com/blog/help-training/salesforce-hack-how-to-add-more-fields-to-related-lists/

6. we can rename the related lists

Best Practices
--------------
1. Prefer related-list-quick-links over related list whenever possible to increase the page performace.
    https://merfantz.com/blog/how-to-place-related-list-quick-links-in-salesforce-lightning/
    https://sf9to5.com/2019/07/16/set-up-related-quick-links/

2. if all related lists on the page are needed, put each related list on each tab.

3. Use Related list single - to display all siblings records.
     Ex: Let one account has 5 contact records. To display all contact siblings records which associated with the same account record 
         in the contact detail/related tab, use Related record single component

4. Use Related record component with quick action (update action) to group fields into tabs.

5. Use Related record component to update/view parent record details from child record detail tab.

    https://salesforcediaries.com/2019/07/12/showing-editable-parent-record-details-on-child-record-lightning-page-without-code-in-salesforce-lightning-experience/

6. we can use Related List Single component multiple times to create multiple related lists and control the records by criteria (record level, device level, profile level etc)

7. SHOWING PARENT RELATED LIST ON CHILD RECORD PAGE IN LIGHTNING EXPEREIENCE using Related List Single component
    https://salesforcediaries.com/2019/07/12/showing-parent-related-list-on-child-record-page-in-lightning-expereience/

    display the Parentâ€™s Related list into Child Record Page using related list single component.
       https://merfantz.com/blog/how-to-display-the-parent-related-list-into-child-record-page-in-lighting/

8. Full View: A data-dense view that focuses on details and related lists and puts all the information on the same page.
   Grouped View: Divides record information into groupings across multiple regions and tabs.
   set-up -> user settings -> Record Page Settings

9. SHOWING A RELATED LIST BASED ON USER PROFILE

Limitations
-----------
1. Number of columns we can add 10
   3 appraches to display 10 fields: https://salesforcediaries.com/2019/03/26/more-than-four-fields-in-related-list-in-lightning-experience/
   display more than 10 fields:      https://salesforcethinkers.home.blog/2019/08/27/add-more-than-four-fields-to-related-list-in-lightning-experience/
                                     https://salesforcethinkers.home.blog/2019/08/20/add-more-fields-to-related-lists-salesforce/

   work around to add more than 10 fields: https://silverlinecrm.com/blog/help-training/salesforce-hack-how-to-add-more-fields-to-related-lists/
   
   Copy and Paste VFEditor.MAX_RELATED_LIST_COLUMNS = x at the console prompt and press Enter. 
   You may replace the letter x with the number of Columns (i.e. = 20) that you want to display. 

2. Related List doesn't have bulk supported quick actions like (mass update, mass delete, mass transfer etc...)
   work around-1: we can buid custom quick actions to support this.
   work around-2: we can create mass quick actions for list view. (some times it is very useful to perform mass actions)

3. doesn't support inline editing.
   Need to develop custom LWC.
   https://cafeforce.com/related-list-inline-edit-lightning-component-salesforce/


4. we can't group the related records by some criteria (Ex: Active vs Inactive)
   work around: create multiple lookup fields to create multiple related lists.

5. Clone with Related List
    https://salesforcespace.blogspot.com/2016/03/clone-with-related-list.html


Note-1: we can Break up Salesforce Record Detail fields into Tabs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmjP6HZDEes


Note-2: Dynamic forms for Standard objects
        The idea here is to use a Quick Action and Related Record standard lightning component on the lightning record page with conditional visibility.
