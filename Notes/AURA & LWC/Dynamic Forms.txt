Limitations
-----------
Currently, Dynamic Forms support only custom objects record pages.For standard objects, you would still have to continue with page layout editor to update/add fields on object page layouts.
The new Field Section & the Field components are not supported on mobile. So, you will need to add a new Record Detail – Mobile component.
Existing page layouts still manage the related lists.
We can add up to 100 fields per column in a Field Section component.
Dynamic Forms aren't available on record pages that use pinned-region or custom page templates.
The component “Field section” is not mobile supported. Any migrated page will automatically have the setting for showing the detail pages on mobile-enabled but you would have to manually enable it for new pages.
